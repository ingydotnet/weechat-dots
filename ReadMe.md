# weechat-dots -- WeeChat Config

This repository contains a stock config for WeeChat v0.3.7, which is stock on
Ubuntu 12.04.

There are 2 out of 11 `.conf` that I want to configure. Those 2 are under
template/ and have tt2 sections in them. A Makefile and takes concise data
from weechat.yml and applies it to the templates as necessary.
